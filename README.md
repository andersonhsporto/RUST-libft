* > [ru_isalpha](/ft_isalpha.c) `(int	ft_isalpha(int c))` checks  for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(c) || isdigit(c)).

* > [ru_isdigit](/ft_isdigit.c) `(int	ft_idigit(int c))` checks for a digit (0 through 9).

* > [ru_isalnum](/ft_isalnum.c) `(int	ft_isalnum(int c))` checks for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(c) || isdigit(c)).

* > [ru_isascii](/ft_isascii.c) `(int	ft_isascii(int c))` checks whether c is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the ASCII character set.
